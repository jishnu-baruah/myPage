# TODO: Portfolio Site Integration & Polish

## 1. RAG + Gemini Integration (Context-Augmented Generation)
- [ ] Update chat/Q&A flow to:
    - [ ] First call the RAG server for context.
    - [ ] Then call Gemini API, passing both the user's question and the RAG context.
    - [ ] Display Gemini's answer, and optionally the context used.
- [ ] Add error handling and loading states for both RAG and Gemini API calls.
- [ ] (Optional) Show a "powered by Gemini + RAG" badge or info.
- [ ] Create a utility/hook for the two-step process (RAG â†’ Gemini).
- [ ] Ensure the context is formatted clearly for Gemini (e.g., "Context: ... Question: ...").

## 2. RAG Server Integration
- [x] Add API client for FastAPI RAG server (REST calls)
- [x] Integrate RAG server for:
    - [x] Portfolio Q&A (site-wide or in chat)
    - [x] Project/Info/Contact page enhancements (contextual answers, smart suggestions)
- [x] Add error handling and loading states for RAG queries

## 3. Gemini (Google AI) Integration
- [x] Set up Gemini free tier API client (REST or SDK)
- [x] Add Gemini as a fallback or alternative to RAG for chat/answers
- [x] UI toggle or auto-selection between RAG and Gemini

- [ ] Polish mobile responsiveness (test all pages/components)
- [ ] Add loading skeletons/placeholders for async content

## 5. Chat & Smart Features
- [ ] Enhance chat interface to support both RAG and Gemini
- [ ] Add message history, copy-to-clipboard, and feedback (like/dislike) options
